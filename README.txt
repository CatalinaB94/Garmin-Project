Title: The Data-Driven Athlete: Exploring Activity Trends and Cost-Effectiveness

Introduction: 
In this project, I delve into a personal exploration of my active lifestyle as captured through the lens of data. Throughout the year, I enjoy experimenting with various activities to stay fit and energized, each offering its own unique blend of challenges and rewards. This endeavor has not only been a journey of physical well-being but also an opportunity to satisfy my curiosity about the patterns and trends hidden within my activity data. To this end, I've recorded data using my Garmin watch, capturing a wide array of metrics that reflect my diverse fitness routine. My objective is to analyze this rich dataset to uncover insights into my activity patterns, evaluate the effectiveness of different exercises, and determine the most cost-effective activities. This analysis is not just a quantitative review of my fitness regime but a deeper understanding of how different activities contribute to my overall fitness goals and budget. By leveraging data science techniques, I aim to uncover the story that my fitness data tells, hoping to draw actionable conclusions that could guide my future fitness endeavors.
